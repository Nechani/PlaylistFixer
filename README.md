**Playlist Fixer** is a utility for repairing broken `.m3u / .m3u8` playlists  
when audio files are moved, renamed, converted, or used across different devices.

It is designed for **file-based playlist users** — not tied to any specific player.

---

## ✨ What Problem Does This Solve?

If you ever experienced:

- Changing computers and **all playlists break**
- Converting audio formats (FLAC → ALAC / WAV / DSF…) and playlists no longer work
- Moving music folders and **paths no longer match**
- DAP (Digital Audio Player) **missing tracks or failing to load playlists**
- Wanting to move **DAP playlists back to PC/Mac players**
- Playlists partially working but **silently skipping songs**

👉 **Playlist Fixer is built for exactly these situations.**

## 🔧 What Playlist Fixer Can Do

- Repair broken `.m3u / .m3u8` playlists
- Automatically re-link tracks by scanning your music library
- Handle:
  - Moved folders
  - Renamed files
  - Different drive letters
  - Format changes (FLAC / ALAC / WAV / DSF / DFF / etc.)
- Detect and classify:
  - ✅ Automatically resolved tracks
  - ⚠️ Ambiguous matches (multiple candidates)
  - ❌ Missing / failed tracks
- Let users **manually choose the correct file** when needed
- Export a **clean, fixed playlist** without modifying originals

## 🎧 DAP & Cross-Device Use

Playlist Fixer is especially useful if you:

- Use **DAPs** (Sony, Astell&Kern, FiiO, iBasso, etc.)
- Move playlists between:
  - Windows / macOS
  - Computer ↔ DAP
- Have playlists that:
  - Load but miss tracks
  - Fail due to unsupported paths or formats

It works at the **file & path level**, not player-specific logic.

## 🧠 Why This Tool Exists

Most players assume:
> “If the path is broken, the playlist is dead.”

Playlist Fixer assumes:
> “If the file still exists somewhere, we can find it.”

This tool is built for people who **organize music seriously** and rely on playlists.

2. Import broken playlist(s)
3. Run **Repair**
